# Why hn_debias?

The vast majority of the readers are probably puzzled.
What is the point of this stupid extension? What could possibly be achieved with this?

It is worth mentioning that I wrote this extension to scratch my own itch.
I do not intend to make any sort of statement, satire or criticism. I wrote this because I wanted this.
It works for me, solves my problem the way I wanted, but might very well be useless for you.

As a regular HN reader, I started noticing a simple pattern: the most downvoted comment is often the most interesting.
Something that is very thought provoking, or that it challenges common assumptions will often attract a storm of downvotes.
This applies both to technical comments and to comments on more subjective topics such as religion, ethics or politics.

For example, jf Joe hacker posts an open question on how to solve a given problem,
those replying with the most known solution will get most up the upvotes,
while a new unknown solution will be thrown to the bottom of the page.\
Or, in the case of subjective topics, any non politically correct view will be downvoted to oblivion.

Realizing this, I ended up up developing the simple reflex of scrolling to the bottom of each page.
But this still exposes me to bias. I still knew which comments were popular and which ones were controversial.
I wanted to not have this knowledge. In other words, I am not interested in the judgment the hacker news crowd
makes on its comments. Only on the comments content itself, possibly.
